## Altera FPGA DE1-SoC-MTL2
To my project i used Altera chip. The DE1-SoC Development Kit presents a robust hardware design platform built around the Altera
System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA, which combines the latest dual-core Cortex-A9 embedded cores
with industry-leading programmable logic for ultimate design flexibility. Users can now leverage
the power of tremendous re-configurability paired with a high-performance, low-power processor
system. Alteraâ€™s SoC integrates an ARM-based hard processor system (HPS) consisting of processor,
peripherals and memory interfaces tied seamlessly with the FPGA fabric using a high-bandwidth
interconnect backbone. The DE1-SoC development board is equipped with high-speed DDR3
memory, video and audio capabilities, Ethernet networking, and much more that promise many
exciting applications.
